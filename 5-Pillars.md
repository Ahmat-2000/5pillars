# The Five Pillars of a Information/Cyber Security Professional

## TLD;DR:
To start, or level up, a career in Cyber Security you need to be proficient in five key areas of technical skills.  You don't have to *master* each one of them, but you need to have a good understanding of them.  Befor you can leap straight into a field like forensics or penetration testing you need understand the environments of those fields.  The five areas are:
1. General Computing
2. Computer Networking
3. Scripting and Programming
4. Linux / MacOS
5. Windows

Don't be scared! While you won't learn it over night you only need the fundamentals.  That said, you also can't expect to get to where you need to be over night.  If you want to accel in this industry you must also **love** learning.  While it takes a lot of dedication a healthy balance is key.  Make sure your family and friends get time with you, or that you make time to do hobbies you love.

Now on to the document...

# readme.txt
This document is a path forward for new, and experienced, cyber professionals to obtaining a concrete foundation of knowledge to enable them for success in the industry.  Mastering the basics of each functional area is required to operate on a cyber team (or alone) in a meaningful and effective way.  A lack of fundamentals in any one pillar can quickly render a team member ineffective during dynamic and rapidly evolving situations.  Conversely, no one person on the team should be, or can be, a cyber unicorn.

Ideally, everyone will have a specialty they excel at in addition to a solid baseline in the fundamentals.  It should not be expected that every one completely masters each pillar.  The intent is to master the fundamentals.  The fundamentals are simply primal blocks of knowledge of each topic; somewhere between the absolute basics and intermediate.  As an example, a team member should understand: sub-netting, routing, OSI model, packet capture, DNS and analysis basics.  This does not mean they need to be Cisco network engineers with a CCNA.

## What You Need (Equipment)

You do not need a $3000 Gaming Laptop or a Desktop with 2 GPU's and 10 TB SSD.  This is completely based on your budget.  You can get away with a $500 laptop if needed. I will explain.

|Level|Explaination|
|---|---|
|Good ($500)|A computer capable of web browsing and reading books. Seriously. The trade off is you will need to pay for web accessible labs versus building a small virtualized environment.|
|Better ($1100ish)|A laptop capable of building a small lab of 2-3 Virtual Machines. Something like an i7, 16 Gigs or RAM and 500 Gigs storage.|
|Best|The sky is the limit.  Something capable of cracking passwords decently (read a mid tier GPU), i9, 32 Gigs, and 1 TB storage.|

**Note**: A GPU is mentioned for password cracking.  You absolutely DO NOT NEED ONE to learn or level up cyber security.  Keep in mind this document is about learning and labs you encounter will be geared towards this anyhow.  You get the same training value in cracking a simple password with your CPU as you do with letting a GPU pound on a hash for 2 weeks.

# The Five Pillars (Functional Areas) of Cyber Security

1. General Computing
2. Computer Networking
3. Programming and Scripting
4. Windows
5. Linux

## Fundamentals Breakdown
The following are key skill sets within each pillar.  It is not an exhaustive list.

|General Computing|Networking|Programming and Scripting|Windows|Linux|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Hardware Components: CPU, RAM, SSD/HDD, Threads, Processes, Process Trees|OSI Model, TCP/IP Model, TCP vs UDP, Packet Analysis, Packet Capture, Routing, DNS, ARP|Python, Powershell, BASH. Bonus: C++ or C#|Registry(5 Hives), Volume Shadow Copies, UAC, Memory Paging, .msi vs .exe, DLLs, RIDs, SIDs, Tokens, Network Profiles, Server vs. Workstation. Commands: Netstat, whoami, ping, ipconfig, Powershell Remoting. Tools: Sysinternals, Process Hacker.|Directory Hierarchy, sudo accounts, /etc/shadow and /etc/passwd, ssh, telnet and ftp.  Software Repositories.  Be Familiar with Distributions: Kali, Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, RedHat.  Commands: w, find, whoami, which, who, ss, watch, ssh, lsof, ssh-add, top, htop, sudo, nano and vim.|

Yes.  That is a lot.  First, to be good in this industry you will want to be *familiar* with each of these things and beyond.  You will not learn it all over night nor should you try.  Just refer back to this often as a guide.  Be patient. Enjoy the journey.

## Desired Endstate of Each Pillar

The following are goals to shoot for in each area.  If you can meet each of these you will be a competent professional ready to shine at interviews and be an asset to any team you join.

|General Computing|Networking|Programming and Scripting|Windows|Linux|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Explain the difference between something being stored in memory vs. something stored on disk. Explain the basics of process injection. Explain the difference between killing a thread and killing a process.|Using all 7 layers of the OSI model explain how a piece of information flows from your computer to google.com and back when you type `ping google.com`.|Be able to write a basic script to automate a simple task; and be able to read and understand the overall idea of what someone else’s script is attempting to do.|Be able to write a basic script to automate a simple task; and be able to read and understand the overall idea of what someone else’s script is attempting to do.|Be able to explain sudo, shadow and passwd files, user groups and proper installation and maintenance of software (repos).Be able to maneuver the OS with command line only and look for network connections and their related processes.|
